// This is a half adder. A half adder adds two bits and produces a sum and carry-out.
module half_adder( 
input a, b,
output cout, sum );

// This is the structural code for a half adder
// The output is the sum of a and b.
// The carry out is the bitwise or of a and b.
// This is known as a ripple carry adder.

// assign sum = a ^ b;
// assign cout = a & b;

// This is a combinational circuit.
// The output is a function of the inputs.
// The inputs a and b are functions of the clock.

// The sum and carry out are functions of the clock.

// The carry out is the logical or of the two inputs a and b.
