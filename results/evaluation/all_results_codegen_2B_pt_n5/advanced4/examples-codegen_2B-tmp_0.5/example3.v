// Design a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. 
// The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.
module advshift(input clk,
input load,
input ena,
input [1:0] amount,
input [63:0] data,
output reg [63:0] q); 
// when load is high, assign data[63:0] to shift register q.
// if ena is high, shift q.
// amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
// 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
// 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
// 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
// 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.


// This design is a bit unusual. The shift register is a bit of a mix of hardware and software.
// It's a shift register that stores a value and loads it back when it is requested.
// It's a synchronous register, but it can be set to a synchronous mode.
// In this design, the shift register is not a hardware register, but is a software register.
// The shift register is a register that can be set to a synchronous mode.
// The shift register is set to synchronous mode when ena is high.
// The shift register is set to asynchronous mode when ena is low.
// When ena is high, the shifter loads the data register.
// When ena is low, the shifter loads the data register and sets the shift register to synchronous mode.
// When ena is low, the shifter loads the data register and sets the shift register to asynchronous mode.endmodule
