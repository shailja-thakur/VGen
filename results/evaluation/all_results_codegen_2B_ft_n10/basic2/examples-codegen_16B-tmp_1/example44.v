// Design a module that implements an AND gate

module and_gate( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // assing the AND of a and b to out

assign out 

assign a
assign b

//top.v - variable declarations

`include"file3.v"	//This has a copy it

//Including an already declared vivible to use in vertex
//
//So here's the idea of it:
//in this file the x,y and z values of each vertex can be caculated already,
//and they are declared GPS VEFr, not just the last x,y and z coordinates in the Vertex Buffer
//So all we have to do is a simple add of each individual coordinate to the respective buffer to give
//us the answer that we need.
//Oh, do we have to check all the incoming codes and assign the way things are, or can the compiler do that for us?
