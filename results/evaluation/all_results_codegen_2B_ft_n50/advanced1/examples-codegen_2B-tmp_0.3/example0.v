// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); 

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low



// The output is a 8-bit 2's complement number. The most significant bit is the sign bit.
// The least significant bit is the overflow bit.

// The overflow bit is the least significant bit of the sum.

// The sum is the sum of the two inputs.

// The sign bit is the sign of the first input.

// The overflow bit is the sign of the sum.

// The sum is the sum of the two inputs.
