// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low


// The signed adder is implemented as a function. 
// The function takes two inputs a and b and returns the sum of the two inputs as a 32-bit number. 
// The function also returns the occurence of a signed overflow. 
// The function should be written in a way that it can be called repeatedly to add more inputs. 
// The function should not return any values. 
// The function should be written in a way that it can be called recursively. 
// The function should be written in a way that it can be called in a loop.
