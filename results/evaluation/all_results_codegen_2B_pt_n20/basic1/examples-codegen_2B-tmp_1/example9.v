// Design a module that assigns the output to the input
module wire_assign( input in, output out );
// assign out to in
// assign out to in, with no newlines
// assign out to in, using 200 as continuation breaks
// the entire system can stand without replicated code,
// along with a global range of numbers

// the entire system can by its observations alone
// allowing future growth

// all your scripts here
// thank you
