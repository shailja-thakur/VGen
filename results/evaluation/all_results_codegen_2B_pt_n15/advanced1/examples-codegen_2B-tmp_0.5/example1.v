// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); 

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low



// Tasks:
// 1. Write a function that takes two 8-bit 2's complement numbers a and b and returns the sum of a and b.
// 2. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns the occurence of a signed overflow.
// 3. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns the occurence of a signed overflow.

// 4. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns the sum of a and b.
// 5. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns the occurence of a signed overflow.
// 6. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns the occurence of a signed overflow.
// 7. Write a function that takes a 8-bit 2's complement number a and returns theendmodule
