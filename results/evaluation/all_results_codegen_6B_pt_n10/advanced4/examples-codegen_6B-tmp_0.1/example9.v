// Design a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. 
// The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.
module advshift(input clk,
input load,
input ena,
input [1:0] amount,
input [63:0] data,
output reg [63:0] q); 
// when load is high, assign data[63:0] to shift register q.
// if ena is high, shift q.
// amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
// 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
// 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
// 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
// 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.


// The following is a testbench for the shift register.
// It is not a complete implementation, but it demonstrates the basic
// functionality.

// The shift register is a register that can shift bits left or right.
// The register is clocked by the clock input.
// The register is loaded by the load input.
// The register is enabled by the enable input.
// The register is shifted by the amount input.
// The register is output by the register output.

// The register is implemented as a 64-bit register.
// The register is implemented as a 64-bit register.
