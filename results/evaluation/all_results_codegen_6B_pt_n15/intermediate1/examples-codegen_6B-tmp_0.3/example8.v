// The half adder is a single bit adder.
// The input is two bits, and the output is a single bit.
// The sum is the sum of the inputs, and the carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The sum is the low-order bit of the sum, and the carry-out is the high-order bit of the sum.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-out of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the carry-outendmodule
