The block can be placed between two gates that do not share any connections. All the connections that begin and ones formed from within this block are implicitly marked as internal.\n\nstructural. Once each block is closed, the connections between those blocks become internal.\n\nFor real world designs, it is necessary to write a converter that can determine the order the constraints are to be defined\nif they are to be visualized on the screen. In the present test bench, two gates are created, and it is essential to connect the output of the previous gate to the previous one in the order given.
