// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,

); 

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low


// The output overflow is a single bit. 
// The output s is a 8-bit number. 
// The output carry is a single bit. 

// The addition is done in two's complement form. 
// The most significant bit of the sum is the carry output. 
// The least significant bit of the sum is the output s. 

// The addition is done using the logic operations and the overflow is detected using the carry output. 

// The carry output is the only output of the adder. 

// The output overflow is the only output of the adder. 

// The carry output is the only output of the adder. 

// The output overflow is the only output of the adder. 

// The carry output is the only output of the adder. 

// The output overflow is the only output of the adder.
