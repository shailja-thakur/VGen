// We can't use a submodule because we need to declare the variable as a clk

// If we declare it as a clk, clk is a pointer to a clk object.
// If we declare it as a clk object, clk is a pointer to a clk object.

// It is a pointer to a register, two bits per register

// If you declare a register as a pointer, register is a pointer to a register

// So we can't declare a pointer to a pointer

// We can declare a pointer to a register, two bits per register

// There is no such thing as a pointer to a pointer

// We can declare a variable as a registerendmodule
