// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low



// A signed adder can add two numbers of the same sign and produce a signed result with no overflow.
// If the most significant bit of a and b is high, then the result will be negative.
// If the most significant bit of a and b is low, then the result will be positive.

// If the most significant bit of s is high, then an overflow will occur, because the result is negative.
// If the most significant bit of s is low, then no overflow will occur.

// If a or b is zero, then the signed sum is NaN.
// The sum is NaN if the most significant bit of the sum is high, or if the sum is zero.

// If a or b is infinite, then the sum is NaN.
// The sum is NaN if the most significant bit of the sum is high, or if the sum is zero.
