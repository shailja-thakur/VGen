// This is a half adder. A half adder adds two bits and produces a sum and carry-out.
module half_adder( 
input a, b,
output cout, sum );

// The half adder has two inputs.
// The first input is the sum of the two inputs.
// The second input is the carry-out from the first half adder.
// The output is the sum of the two inputs plus the carry-out.
// The carry-out is the bits that were added in the first half adder.
// The sum is the bits that were added in the second half adder.
// The sum is the bits that are added to the carry-out.
// The carry-out is the bits that are added to the sum.
// The sum is the bits that are added to the carry-out.
// The carry-out is the bits that are added to the sum.
// The sum is the bits that are added to the carry-out.
// The carry-out is the bits that are added to the sum.
// The sum is the bits that are addedendmodule
