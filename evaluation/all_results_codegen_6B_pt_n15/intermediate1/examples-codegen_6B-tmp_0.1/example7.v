// This is a half adder. A half adder adds two bits and produces a sum and carry-out.
module half_adder( 
input a, b,
output cout, sum );

// The half adder is a two-input, two-output module.
// The inputs are two bits, and the outputs are two bits.
// The sum is the sum of the inputs, and the carry-out is the carry-out of the sum.
// The sum is the bitwise AND of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise OR of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise XOR of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise AND of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise OR of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise XOR of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise AND of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise OR of the inputs.
// The carry-out is the bitwise XOR of the inputs.
