// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); 

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low


// Part 1: Create an 8-bit 2's complement adder that can add two 8-bit numbers a[7:0] and b[7:0].

// Part 2: Create an 8-bit 2's complement subtractor that can subtract two 8-bit numbers a[7:0] and b[7:0].

// Part 3: Create a 4-bit binary adder that can add two 4-bit numbers a[3:0] and b[3:0].

// Part 4: Create a 4-bit binary subtractor that can subtract two 4-bit numbers a[3:0] and b[3:0].

// Part 5: Create an 8-bit 3's complement adder that can add two 8-bit numbers a[7:0] and b[7:0].

// Part 6: Create an 8-bit 3's complement subtractor that can subtract twoendmodule
