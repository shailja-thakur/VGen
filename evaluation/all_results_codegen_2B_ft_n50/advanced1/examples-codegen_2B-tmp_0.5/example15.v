// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. 

module signed_adder(input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); 

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low


// The output overflow is the sign of the most significant bit of the sum of a and b.
// The output s is the sum of a and b with the sign of the overflow bit.
// The output overflow is assigned to the output s whenever there is a signed overflow.
// The output overflow is cleared when there is no signed overflow.

// The implementation uses the carry bit to indicate overflow, and uses the carry bit to clear overflow.
// The carry bit is the carry of the adder.

// The addition is carried out by adding the absolute values of the two numbers.
// The carry of the sum is assigned to the carry bit of the adder.

// The subtraction is carried out by adding the absolute values of the two numbers.
// The carry of the subtraction is assigned to the carry bit of the adder.

// The overflow bit is the sign of the most significant bit of the sum.endmodule
