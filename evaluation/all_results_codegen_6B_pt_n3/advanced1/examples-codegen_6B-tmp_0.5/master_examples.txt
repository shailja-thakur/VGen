// The signed adder is a function with the following signature:

// Inputs:
// a is an 8-bit 2's complement number
// b is an 8-bit 2's complement number
// Outputs:
// s is a 8-bit 2's complement number
// overflow is an 8-bit 2's complement number

// This function must return a tuple of two values:
// s and overflow

// The return value of the function must be a tuple of two elements:
// s and overflow

// The return value of the function must be a tuple of two elements:
// s and overflow

// You may assume that the inputs a and b are in the range [-128, 127].

// If the inputs a and b are in the range [-128, 127], their sum is in the range [-128, 127].
