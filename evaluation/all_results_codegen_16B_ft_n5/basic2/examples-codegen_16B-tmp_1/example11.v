principle of this assertion). 
The circuit gets ugly. You can create repetitive blocks or gates that consitute part of the circuit. The block can be placed between two gates that do not share any connections. All the connections that begin and ones formed from within this block are implicitly marked as internal.

structural. Once each block is closed, the connections between those blocks become internal.

For real world designs, it is necessary to write a converter that can determine the order the constraints are to be defined
if they are to be visualized on the screen. In the present test bench, two gates are created, and it is essential to connect the output of the previous gate to the previous one in the order given. (which of the previous gate is assigned to each output can be controlled by the amount of synchronization.
(IMPORTANT: Connections are not assigned one at a time in the order given, so theyend
