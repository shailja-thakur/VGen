// Design a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. 
// The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.

input [63:0] data,
output reg [63:0] q); 
// when load is high, assign data[63:0] to shift register q.
// if ena is high, shift q.
// amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
// 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
// 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
// 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
// 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.


// The shift register is implemented as a 64-bit register.
// The leftmost bit is the least significant bit of the register.
// The rightmost bit is the most significant bit of the register.
// The register is loaded with the value of data[63:0].
// The register is shifted by amount.
// The register is shifted by 1 bit if amount is 0,
// by 8 bits if amount is 1,
// by 1 bit if amount is 2,
// or by 8 bits if amount is 3.
// The register is shifted by 1 bit if amount is 0,
// by 8 bits if amount is 1,
// by 1 bit if amount is 2,
// or by 8 bits if amount is 3.
// The register is shifted by 1 bit if amount is 0,
// by 8 bits if amount is 1,
// by 1 bit if amount is 2,
// or by 8 bits ifendmodule
