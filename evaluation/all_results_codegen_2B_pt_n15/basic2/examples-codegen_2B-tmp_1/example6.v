// Design a module that implements an AND gate

module and_gate( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // assing the AND of a and b to out

and_gate( a, b, out ) returns (and_out);
      
      // And produces a vector of all bits based on two input vectors
      // a and b that are inputs and out as outputs of the function

      // And will generate snk in value and skn - the number of ones. 

      // Where 0 means all 0's and 1 means all 1's

and_gate( a, b, out ) returns (and_out);
      
     // Assing the AND of an array of length 4 to out 
     // with all bits equal to zero
    
     // and_gate[input1 , input2, input3, input4]=out

and_gate in used to determine the number of bits to expect draw from the source

and_gate src= in used to select the input bits to an output

on_and_out state produces on_endmodule
