// Design a module that implements an AND gate

module and_gate( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

    // assing the AND of a and b to out. Write code in the body 


// to implement the module. If you already know how to 


// write an AND gate, you may use it. 



// write code to implement the module gate called and_gate. 


// Use the context switch example in the lab as a template. 


// Start your answer from the ( *) statement of the question. 


// Remember the order in which signals should be connected 


// to eachother as expressed in the question. 


// when a is 1, write 1 to wire out 


// when a is 0, do not write anything to wire 


// when b is 1, write 1 in wire out 


// when b is 0, do not write anything to wire 



// the A out bit overrides b when both are 1 (don't really care) 


// and assume a *always*endmodule
