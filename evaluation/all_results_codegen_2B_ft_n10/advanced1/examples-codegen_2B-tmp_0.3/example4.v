// Design a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0].

// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// assign the occurence of the signed overflow of a and b to the output overflow.
// a signed overflow occurs if the most significant bits of a and b are low and the most significant bit of s is high
// a signed overflow may also occur if the most significant bits of a and b are high and the most significant bit of s is low



// The output s is equal to the sum of a and b.
// The output overflow is the signed overflow of a and b.

// The output overflow is a 1 if there was a signed overflow.

// The output overflow is a 0 if there was no signed overflow.

// The output overflow is a 0 if the two inputs were both 0.

// The output overflow is a 1 if the two inputs were both 1.

// The output overflow is a 0 if the two inputs were both 1 or 0.

// The output overflow is a 0 if the two inputs were both 0 or 1.

// The output overflow is a 0 if the two inputs were both 0 or 1.

// The output overflow is a 0 if the two inputs were both 0 or 1.

// The output overflow is a 1 if the two inputs were both 1 or 0.

// The output overflow is a 0endmodule
